### Overview
This repository provides the code to reproduce my master thesis "Simulation-based comparison of Bayesian inference methods in hierarchical bayesian models". `simulation.R` simulates the temporal discounting task and creates the folder `out/` with its underneath folder structure. For each sample, `params.rds` is saved which includes the parameter values used for simulation of each subject. `data.rds` includes the information about each trial and the choice in long format. After simulating, hierarchical Bayesian models can be fitted to the data with `modeling.R`, which creates the model files containing model parameter estimates within each samples folder. `.stan` model files can be found in `models/`. The `analysis.R` file computes the final data frame `final_results.rds`, which includes the sample number, prior SD, population effect SD, values of Bayesian inference methods, and dummy-coded variables indicating whether conventional and simulation-based decision thresholds produced false positive results or not for each model. All plots can be created with `plots.R`. The results section was written with R Markdown using the package `papaja` (Aust & Barth, 2022). Knitting `results.Rmd` produces a .pdf file including the LaTeX code to produce the results section.
